# Analog Clock

A beautiful analog clock implementation using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The clock features a clean design with hour, minute, and second hands.

## Features

- Real-time analog clock display
- Smooth hand movements
- Modern UI with shadow effects
- 12-hour format display

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (Vanilla)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/analog-clock.git
```

2. Open `index.html` in your web browser

## Project Structure

- `index.html` - The main HTML structure
- `style.css` - Contains all styling including the clock face design
- `app.js` - JavaScript logic for clock hand movements

## How It Works

The clock uses JavaScript's `Date` object to get the current time and calculates the appropriate rotation angles for the hour, minute, and second hands. The rotations are applied using CSS transforms, and the clock is updated every second using `setInterval`.
